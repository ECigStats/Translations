To translate, go to Options in ECigStats and right click on the Version: 1.0 three times.
Then click Edit Translations.

Make a copy of en.po and replace what is inside msgstr "" with a translation of what is in msgid "".
Name it by your language code. For example: de.po en-GB.po it.po zh-Hans.po zh-Hant.po

You can test it by right clicking Version: 1.0 three times again and selecting Test Translation.
